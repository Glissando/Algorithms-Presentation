[Run the project](https://glissando.github.io/Algorithms-Presentation)

A project containing examples of algorithmic design paradigms used for a college presentation. Many examples are inspired by the books [Algorithmic Puzzles](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Puzzles-Anany-Levitin/dp/0199740445) and [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365)

![alt text](https://github.com/Glissando/Algorithms-Presentation/blob/master/raw/iterative_algorithm.png "Iterative algorithm")

There are still many examples to be added, based off the content of these books.
